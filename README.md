## Summary
In this document, we propose implementing the **Smithâ€“Waterman algorithm** for local sequence alignment using the **systolic array parallel programming model** on AWS Trainium via the AWS Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI). This algorithm features a 2D data passing pattern, which presents a strong opportunity for parallelization on systolic array-based systems.

## Platform choice
We'd like to use [AWS's Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/) platform. This platform uses Trainium chips, which use the NeuronCore architecture and are [based off of systolic arrays](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/how-to-extend-the-functionality-of-aws-trainium-with-custom-operators/). The combination of multiple engines, fast interconnect, and multiple cores, makes these a perfect chip for running systolic array workloads.

We'll be using the [Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI) language](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/nki/index.html) to construct our implementation, which provides some low-level contructs to make full-use of the NeuronCores. The library provides both high-level collective-communication abstractions and low-level CUDA-like reduction operations.
