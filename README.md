## Summary
In this document, we propose implementing the **Smithâ€“Waterman algorithm** for local sequence alignment using the **systolic array parallel programming model** on AWS Trainium via the AWS Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI). This algorithm features a 2D data passing pattern, which presents a strong opportunity for parallelization on systolic array-based systems.
